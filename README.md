Simple System 


Before starting, make the log folder structure:
log/client, log/lb and log/frontend

to run on rocksvv:
run /bash/rocksvv/terminalstart.sh

to run on uvrocks:
Start the modules on the nodes configured in the config.json file
To start more frontends and clients without manually start every node, the runClient.sh and runfrontnode.sh can be used instead.
